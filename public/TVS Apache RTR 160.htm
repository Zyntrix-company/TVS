It gives a mileage of around 43–45 km/l, which is decent for its power. The pickup and throttle response are smooth, and it handles really well on highways — stable even at high speeds. In city rides, it tends to get a bit warm and you can feel some vibrations, especially at higher RPMs, but that’s manageable. The braking is sharp, and the seating position is comfortable for medium rides. Overall, it’s a reliable and stylish bike, best suited for highway cruising and occasional city rides.","name":"“Power Packed Performance with Style – Apache Never Disappoints!”","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":5,"ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1}},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vaibhav Dhiman"},"datePublished":"11/05/2025","description":"I own this bike for around 1 year, this bike fits my riding style amd that's why I like it so much. It's meant to overtake things not to cruise around. Now about that \"almost\" part..... It's front suspension is way soft for the design and type of bike it is. So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it's nothing! Vibrations? Yeah it's a vibrator to be honest but it kinda makes my heartbeat faster because of it.... Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you're riding something powerful. I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension. Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol. So 500rs petrol and 250km = 50kmpl. I've gone to shimla 3-4 times and the story is the same. I didn't ride it calmly either (you know it's an Apache...). PERFECT COMBINATION OF PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICALITY","name":"PERFECT............

For 2023, the Apache RTR 160 gets an updated headlight design that features an LED setup along with twin LED DRLs. The design looks modern, if not futuristic and the Apache RTR 160 looks more visually appealing than ever before. Meanwhile, it retains styling elements such as a body-coloured headlight cowl, a black visor, a muscular fuel tank with bold graphics and a 3D logo on the shrouds, an engine cowl, and a split-style pillion grabrail. The carbon-fibre texture on the side and the rear panels further enhance the sportiness of the package.</p><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Instrument Cluster' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Instrument Cluster' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-instrument-cluster86.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&amp;q=75' class='lazy'></div><p style='text-align:justify;'>The cockpit gets an update too, and the Apache RTR 160 drops the semi-digital layout for a fully-digital instrument cluster that is similar to the unit on the Apache RTR 160 4V. The highest-spec version also gets Bluetooth connectivity. The paint quality looks premium while the switchgear operates well. The ‘Mode’ switch is easily accessible too, making it easy to toggle between the riding modes on the fly. However, the plastic around the switches, especially around the joints, could have been of a better finish. Excluding these, we did not find any other build quality issues on this motorcycle.</p><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Left Front Three Quarter' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Left Front Three Quarter' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-left-front-three-quarter31.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&amp;q=75' class='lazy'></div><p>Then, the styling is appealing and it does manage to grab attention on the road, especially in the Racing Red paint colour that you see in the pictures.

But the footpegs are high placed, likely to improve clearance while cornering. Now, tall riders may find the rider’s triangle to be cramped and uncomfortable but shorter riders would like this high position of the footpegs. These footpegs, along with clip-on handlebars, deliver a sporty rider’s triangle and it matches the character of the motorcycle.</p><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Rear Suspension' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Rear Suspension' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-rear-suspension71.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&q=75' class='lazy'></div><p>Despite its sporty character, the suspension setup is surprisingly plush. The front forks and the twin gas-filled rear springs iron out most of the undulations on the road, but the sharper bumps are still noticeable. The seat, too, feels well-padded and you can ride for several hours before you need a break. However, the step-up design limits the movements of the rider. That said, it is easy to move the motorcycle around, and with a full 12-litre fuel tank, it tips the weighing scale at just 138kg.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="o-kY o-lT o-mf o-mO o-nc o-eO" data-testid="expert-review-3" font-size="sm"><div class="o-f o-os o-oz o-aE o-cC o-dP o-c6 o-dj o-bO o-ck"><div class="o-aR o-dZ o-gP "><div class="o-f o-aM o-aE o-ef o-eN"><h4 data-testid="expert-review-expand-title-3" class="o-j1 o-jh">Performance and Handling</h4></div></div><div class="o-f o-aE o-ie o-gT o-eg o-eO o-f7 o-ex  o-j1 o-jK"><svg class="o-aQ o-aS o-aV o-ov o-gS o-ib tIZVk7 o-oi" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentcolor" tabindex="-1" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="img"></svg></div></div><div class="eldbGt" style="height:0px;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" checkTimeout="50"><div class=""><div class="o-f9 o-eB"><div class="foxwNh   articleContent" data-skin="text"><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Rear Three Quarter' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Rear Three Quarter' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-right-rear-three-quarter25.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&amp;q=75' class='lazy'></div><p style='text-align:justify;'>The Apache RTR 160 continues to use a 159.7cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine. The maximum power and peak torque output vary depending on the ride mode selected. The Urban and Rain modes limit the power and torque outputs to 13.1bhp at 8,000rpm and 12.7Nm at 6,500rpm, respectively. Meanwhile, the Sport mode offers access to the full 15.8bhp at 8,750rpm and 13.85Nm at 7,000rpm. Do note that these modes do not alter the engine character. Instead, the Urban and Rain modes limit the revs to 8,000rpm. This, in turn, limits the top speed of the Apache RTR 160 in the lower power modes.</p><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Front Disc Brake Caliper' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Front Disc Brake Caliper' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-front-disc-brake-caliper73.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&amp;q=75' class='lazy'></div><p style='text-align:justify;'>The motor feels comfortable anywhere above 3,000rpm, and it starts to accelerate smoothly post 4,000rpm. It also builds power at a commendable pace and that only starts to fade after 9,000rpm. Still, the motorcycle can cruise at 80kmph at 6,000rpm, while the speedometer indicated top-speed of 125kmph is much higher than the claimed 107kmph in the Sport mode. Moreover, the braking setup complements the performance and the petal-type discs on both wheels offer plenty of initial bite. The five-speed gearbox feels crisp as well and we did not face any shifting issues during the road test.</p><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Rear Tyre' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Rear Tyre' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-rear-tyre82.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&amp;q=75' class='lazy'></div><p>Coming to the handling department, it is engaging as well – thanks to the lightweight of the motorcycle and the sporty ergonomics. Thus, it’s quite engaging when ridden around curving roads. The lightweight also comes in handy while filtering through traffic. But it is limited by the grip levels delivered by the tyres and the stock units are not very confidence inspiring. There is also the Glide Through Technology that aids in bumper-to-bumper traffic. But wait, there’s more.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="o-kY o-lT o-mf o-mO o-nc o-eO" data-testid="expert-review-4" font-size="sm"><div class="o-f o-os o-oz o-aE o-cC o-dP o-c6 o-dj o-bO o-ck"><div class="o-aR o-dZ o-gP "><div class="o-f o-aM o-aE o-ef o-eN"><h4 data-testid="expert-review-expand-title-4" class="o-j1 o-jh">Features and Technology</h4></div></div><div class="o-f o-aE o-ie o-gT o-eg o-eO o-f7 o-ex  o-j1 o-jK"><svg class="o-aQ o-aS o-aV o-ov o-gS o-ib tIZVk7 o-oi" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentcolor" tabindex="-1" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="img"></svg></div></div><div class="eldbGt" style="height:0px;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" checkTimeout="50"><div class=""><div class="o-f9 o-eB"><div class="foxwNh   articleContent" data-skin="text"><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Instrument Cluster' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Instrument Cluster' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-instrument-cluster109.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&q=75' class='lazy'></div><p style='text-align:justify;'>The Glide Through Technology allows the motorcycle to move forward without any throttle input.

Then, the top-spec variant gets Bluetooth connectivity which works with a dedicated smartphone that offers access to call/SMS alerts along with turn-by-turn navigation.

The low-beam has a wide spread while the high-beam illuminates several metres ahead, thus giving the confidence to go fast in dark riding conditions. Now, while the competition, too, uses LED lighting, the Apache RTR 160 2V has an edge in terms of additional functions such as detailed instrument cluster readings and Bluetooth connectivity. Not to mention, it’s efficient when it comes to fuel economy as well.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="o-kY o-lT o-mf o-mO o-nc o-eO" data-testid="expert-review-5" font-size="sm"><div class="o-f o-os o-oz o-aE o-cC o-dP o-c6 o-dj o-bO o-ck"><div class="o-aR o-dZ o-gP "><div class="o-f o-aM o-aE o-ef o-eN"><h4 data-testid="expert-review-expand-title-5" class="o-j1 o-jh">Fuel Efficiency</h4></div></div><div class="o-f o-aE o-ie o-gT o-eg o-eO o-f7 o-ex  o-j1 o-jK"><svg class="o-aQ o-aS o-aV o-ov o-gS o-ib tIZVk7 o-oi" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentcolor" tabindex="-1" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" role="img"></svg></div></div><div class="eldbGt" style="height:0px;overflow:hidden" aria-hidden="true" checkTimeout="50"><div class=""><div class="o-f9 o-eB"><div class="foxwNh   articleContent" data-skin="text"><div><img src='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif' alt='TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Side View' title='TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Side View' data-original='https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-right-side-view23.jpeg?isig=0&amp;wm=3&q=75' class='lazy'></div><p>The motorcycle delivered a fuel economy of 61kmpl in our internal efficiency test.

It looks desirable, especially in the Racing Red theme, and has a decent fit and finish. The engine, albeit not eyeball-flattening in terms of acceleration and top speed, has enough character to keep novice riders entertained. Meanwhile, the modern feature list will appeal to young buyers who are looking for their first motorcycle. It is still relevant and achieving sufficient sales in select markets, which is probably why TVS Motor Company has retained this model in its portfolio. It isn’t, however, for an experienced rider and people looking for even better performance should consider the Apache RTR 200 4V which is just Rs 15,000 more expensive than this variant of the Apache RTR 160.</p><p><em>Photography by Kapil Angane and Kaustubh Gandhi</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div><div data-sectionhash="similarBikes"><div class=""><section data-skin="section" class="o-bQ o-eS o-ck o-C "><header class="o-cE o-dH o-c8 o-db o-bO o-ck o-C "><h2 data-skin="title" class="o-js o-jJ o-j5 o-jl ">Street Bikes Similar to Apache RTR 160</h2></header><div class="o-cw o-c0 o-bO o-cg o-C "><div><div class="o-C  "><div class="Qis0gL o-t Nw18AV o-ci" data-slidesperview="2"><div style="overflow-x:hidden;width:50%" data-testid="similar-cars-carousel" arrowVisibility="default" autoPlayDelay="3000" activeDotsColor="neutral-100"><div style="-webkit-flex-direction:row;flex-direction:row;-webkit-transition:all 0s ease 0s;transition:all 0s ease 0s;-webkit-transform:translate(0%, 0);transform:translate(0%, 0);direction:ltr;display:flex;will-change:transform" class="react-swipeable-view-container"><div style="width:100%;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;flex-shrink:0;overflow:auto" data-swipeable="true"><div style="height:100%" class="o-cz o-c3 zFXs8Z"><div class=""><div class="o-iD o-C"><div class="o-f o-aw o-o o-lT o-mf o-ne o-nn  o-mO o-ha o-hA o-iD o-l4 o-lA

It gives a mileage of around 43–45 km/l, which is decent for its power. The pickup and throttle response are smooth, and it handles really well on highways — stable even at high speeds. In city rides, it tends to get a bit warm and you can feel some vibrations, especially at higher RPMs, but that’s manageable. The braking is sharp, and the seating position is comfortable for medium rides. Overall, it’s a reliable and stylish bike, best suited for highway cruising and occasional city rides.</p><div data-testid="rating-parameters"><div class="o-aF o-em o-fW o-f"><p class="o-j1 o-jh o-js

It's meant to overtake things not to cruise around. </br>   Now about that "almost" part..... It's front suspension is way soft for the design and type of bike it is. So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it's nothing! Vibrations? Yeah it's a vibrator to be honest but it kinda makes my heartbeat faster because of it.... Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you're riding something powerful. </br>    I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension.</br>    Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol. So 500rs petrol and 250km = 50kmpl. I've gone to shimla 3-4 times and the story is the same. I didn't ride it calmly either (you know it's an Apache...). </br>PERFECT COMBINATION OF PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICALITY</p><div data-testid="rating-parameters"><div class="o-aF o-em o-fW o-f"><p

It gives a mileage of around 43–45 km/l, which is decent for its power. The pickup and throttle response are smooth, and it handles really well on highways — stable even at high speeds. In city rides, it tends to get a bit warm and you can feel some vibrations, especially at higher RPMs, but that’s manageable. The braking is sharp, and the seating position is comfortable for medium rides. Overall, it’s a reliable and stylish bike, best suited for highway cruising and occasional city rides.</p><div data-testid="rating-parameters"><div class="o-aF o-em o-fW o-f"><p class="o-j1 o-jh o-js

It's meant to overtake things not to cruise around. </br>   Now about that "almost" part..... It's front suspension is way soft for the design and type of bike it is. So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it's nothing! Vibrations? Yeah it's a vibrator to be honest but it kinda makes my heartbeat faster because of it.... Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you're riding something powerful. </br>    I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension.</br>    Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol. So 500rs petrol and 250km = 50kmpl. I've gone to shimla 3-4 times and the story is the same. I didn't ride it calmly either (you know it's an Apache...). </br>PERFECT COMBINATION OF PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICALITY</p><div data-testid="rating-parameters"><div class="o-aF o-em o-fW o-f"><p

Here’s why:</br>1. Performance Issues: While the engine is decent for city rides, it lacks the punch I was expecting for highway cruising. The acceleration feels sluggish after hitting around 60 km/h, and overtaking on highways can be a hassle.</br>2. Vibration Problem: One of the most annoying issues I’ve encountered is the vibrations. At higher speeds (above 60 km/h), the bike shakes quite a bit, especially in the foot pegs and handlebars, which makes longer rides uncomfortable.</br>3. Fuel Efficiency: The bike is advertised as fuel-efficient, but I’ve found it to be a bit underwhelming compared to other bikes in the same segment. I expected better mileage for a commuter bike.</br>4. Build Quality: The build feels a bit plasticky, especially around the body panels. The finishing on some parts looks cheap, and I’ve already had a couple of rattles after just a few thousand kilometres.</p><div data-testid="rating-parameters"><div class="o-aF o-em o-fW o-f"><p

Thus, with its 12-litre fuel tank, the Apache RTR 160 can cover a distance of 732km between fuel stops.\u003c/p\u003e","pageType":"NonCollapsible","sectionScore":0.0},{"pageId":152575,"priority":7,"pageName":"Should you buy it?","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cimg src=\u0027https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/0x0/statics/grey.gif\u0027 alt=\u0027TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Front Three Quarter\u0027 title=\u0027TVS Apache RTR 160 Right Front Three Quarter\u0027 data-original=\u0027https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/642x361/n/cw/ec/139691/tvs-apache-160-right-front-three-quarter4.jpeg?isig=0\u0026amp;wm=3\u0026amp;q=75\u0027 class=\u0027lazy\u0027\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThings that really work for the 2023 TVS Apache RTR 160 are its styling, engine, and feature list. It looks desirable, especially in the Racing Red theme, and has a decent fit and finish. The engine, albeit not eyeball-flattening in terms of acceleration and top speed, has enough character to keep novice riders entertained. Meanwhile, the modern feature list will appeal to young buyers who are looking for their first motorcycle. It is still relevant and achieving sufficient sales in select markets, which is probably why TVS Motor Company has retained this model in its portfolio. It isn’t, however, for an experienced rider and people looking for even better performance should consider the Apache RTR 200 4V which is just Rs 15,000 more expensive than this variant of the Apache RTR 160.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhotography by Kapil Angane and Kaustubh Gandhi\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","pageType":"NonCollapsible","sectionScore":0.0}],"categoryId":8},"similarBikes":[{"keySpecs":[{"title":"Fuel Type","identifier":"383","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"Petrol"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Displacement","identifier":"375","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"163.2 cc"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Mileage - Owner Reported","identifier":"671","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"46 kmpl"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Max Power(bhp)","identifier":"454","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"16.6 bhp"}],"itemMasterId":0}],"userReportedMileage":0.0,"araiMileage":0.0,"overallRating":0.0,"reviewsCount":0,"hostUrl":"https://imgd.aeplcdn.com/","isNewlyLaunched":false,"isPrimeAlternativeSlot":true,"extraSpecs":[{"title":"Fuel Type","identifier":"383","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"Petrol"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Displacement","identifier":"375","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"163.2 cc"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Mileage - Owner Reported","identifier":"671","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"46 kmpl"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Max Power(bhp)","identifier":"454","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"16.6 bhp"}],"itemMasterId":0},{"title":"Kerb Weight","identifier":"397","keySpecsValue":[{"text":"145 kg"}],"itemMasterId":0}],"isSponsoredElectricModel":false,"makeId":6,"makeName":"Hero","subMakeId":0,"fuelTypeId":1,"priceOverview":{"formattedPrice":"₹ 1,30,107","priceLabel":"Avg.

In city rides, it tends to get a bit warm and you can feel some vibrations, especially at higher RPMs, but that’s manageable. The braking is sharp, and the seating position is comfortable for medium rides.

So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it\u0027s nothing! Vibrations?

Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you\u0027re riding something powerful. \u003c/br\u003e    I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension.\u003c/br\u003e    Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol.

So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it\u0027s nothing! Vibrations? Yeah it\u0027s a vibrator to be honest but it kinda makes my heartbeat faster because of it.... Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you\u0027re riding something powerful. \u003c/br\u003e    I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension.\u003c/br\u003e    Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol.

It gives a mileage of around 43–45 km/l, which is decent for its power. The pickup and throttle response are smooth, and it handles really well on highways — stable even at high speeds. In city rides, it tends to get a bit warm and you can feel some vibrations, especially at higher RPMs, but that’s manageable. The braking is sharp, and the seating position is comfortable for medium rides. Overall, it’s a reliable and stylish bike, best suited for highway cruising and occasional city rides.\u0022,\u0022name\u0022:\u0022“Power Packed Performance with Style – Apache Never Disappoints!”\u0022,\u0022reviewRating\u0022:{\u0022@type\u0022:\u0022Rating\u0022,\u0022bestRating\u0022:5,\u0022ratingValue\u0022:4,\u0022worstRating\u0022:1}},{\u0022@type\u0022:\u0022Review\u0022,\u0022author\u0022:{\u0022@type\u0022:\u0022Person\u0022,\u0022name\u0022:\u0022Vaibhav Dhiman\u0022},\u0022datePublished\u0022:\u002211/05/2025\u0022,\u0022description\u0022:\u0022I own this bike for around 1 year, this bike fits my riding style amd that\u0027s why I like it so much. It\u0027s meant to overtake things not to cruise around. Now about that \\\u0022almost\\\u0022 part..... It\u0027s front suspension is way soft for the design and type of bike it is. So the problem there is that above 100kmph it starts to wobble when you try to change lane and it decreases your confidence alot! So I put 20W fork oil in front suspension and now it rides above 100 like it\u0027s nothing! Vibrations? Yeah it\u0027s a vibrator to be honest but it kinda makes my heartbeat faster because of it.... Loud exhaust sound and vibrations feels like you\u0027re riding something powerful. I changed the fork oil because I rode a classic 350 recently and felt the need for a stiffer suspension. Mileage - I went to Shimla on it solo (125 km from my home) and it requires 500rs of petrol. So 500rs petrol and 250km = 50kmpl. I\u0027ve gone to shimla 3-4 times and the story is the same. I didn\u0027t ride it calmly either (you know it\u0027s an Apache...).
